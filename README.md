Week Eight Questions:

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure my software is functional/secure is to understanding each of my test cases, and the information within. There are a plethora of potential vulnerabilities that could occur when coding. It's vital to utilize that info for testing my own work. Like in many other subjects, drafting is always a good method of tackling fotware requirments effectively.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The most effecient way to interpret user needs is by creating detailed documentation directly with clients of their specific needs. This connection between programmers/clients will assist in breaking down what problems their are (or could be) and creating solutions together. Then, programmers will have am uch clearer understanding of any specific directions needed to take and be able to develop any product(s) to solve said issues at hand.

# How do I approach designing software?

Personally, I think the best approach to designing software (in most methods, anyway) is simplicity. Of course, one must include what is necessary, such as standards of
best practice, any specific adjustments/modifications asked of clients, and a proper, functioning build. But, developing one that is simple and easier to read/understand
significantly helps myself when coding and should help others that look at it in the future, especially those that are looking to make adjustments.
